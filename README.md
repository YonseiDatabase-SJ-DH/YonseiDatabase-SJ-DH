# YonseiDatabase-SJ-DH

Welcome to the YonseiDatabase-SJ-DH GitHub organization! This team was formed as part of a database course project at Yonsei University. Our mission is to explore and implement the entire data lifecycle, from creation and preprocessing to in-depth analysis using SQL. 

## Projects

### 1. **Random Data Generation (Createrandomdata)**
   This project involves generating synthetic datasets using Python. The created data serves as the foundation for further analysis and exercises, simulating real-world scenarios for database manipulation and analysis.

### 2. **Preprocessing CSV Files into SQL Files (Preprocessing-CSV-files-into-sql-files)**
   In this project, we transform CSV-formatted data into SQL files compatible with MySQL. This enables efficient insertion and management of data within a database system. [Learn more about the code here.](https://github.com/YonseiDatabase-SJ-DH/Preprocessing-CSV-files-into-sql-files/blob/main/Whatisthiscode.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3. **Correlating Data with SQL (Correlating-with-SQL)**
   This project focuses on leveraging MySQL to analyze correlations between various data attributes. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## About Us
Our team is dedicated to gaining hands-on experience in database management and analysis. By working through these projects, we aim to deepen our understanding of SQL, enhance our problem-solving skills, and explore the practical applications of database systems.

Feel free to explore our repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or suggestions!
